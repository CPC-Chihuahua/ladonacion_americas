[La donación](https://ladonacion.es) (Spanish for "the donation") is a
data-driven set of rich interactive visualizations exposing all the known
details about the donation in 2012 of 65 million euros from the then King of
Spain, Juan Carlos I, to businesswoman and socialite Corinna zu
Sayn-Wittgenstein.

The whole project, from the design of the data model to the coding itself, has
been done in 2021 by me, [Jaime Gómez-Obregón](https://jaime.gomezobregon.com).

This repository holds the full source code of the website at `ladonacion.es` and
the documentation needed to understand its architecture. By open sourcing it I
aim to encourage and pave the road for other data and investigative journalists
to share their own stories of public interest by reusing and building upon my
work.
